## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Sean1010-cloud/Sean1010-cloud** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Sean, a software engineer major at York University from Canada.

I like coding projects that I will learn from and allow me to further develop my skills.

I mainly write code in Java, using softwares like Eclipse and IntelliJ.

Fun fact: My favourite hobby is gaming
