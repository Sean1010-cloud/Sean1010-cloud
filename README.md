## Hi there 👋

I'm Sean, a software engineering major at York University, from Canada.

I like coding projects that I will learn from and allow me to further develop my problem solving skills.

I mainly write code in Java, using softwares like Eclipse and IntelliJ. However, I have been trying out new tools recently such as SQL for databases.

Fun fact: My favourite hobby is gaming
